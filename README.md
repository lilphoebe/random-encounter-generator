# random-encounter-generator

a *truly* random encounter generator for dnd 5e.

this basic python 5e encounter generator uses the monster lists collected from Monster Manual and other 5th edition supplements to create very goofy encounters based on a party's average level and number of players.

what would happen if a crocodile, a cultist, and a draft horse teamed up against your players? the battle of a lifetime!
